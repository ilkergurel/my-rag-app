      "First, for the question about corticosteroids, I'll check the Medical_book.pdf. On page 78, it mentions Cushing’s syndrome being caused by high levels of hydrocortisone, which is a corticosteroid. It also talks about Addison's disease involving deficiencies in these hormones. Another mention on page 222 discusses corticosteroid drugs used for inflammation and their side effects. So, putting that together, corticosteroids are a type of hormone, often used as medication to reduce inflammation.\n",

      "Now, for the recipe, I'll look into the Student-Cookbook.pdf. On pages 21 and 40, there's a detailed recipe for Homemade Crunchwrap Supreme. It lists ingredients like large tortilla shells, taco meat, queso sauce, sour cream, lettuce, cheese, and optional toppings. The steps involve warming the tortilla, adding the fillings, wrapping it, and cooking in a pan until browned on both sides.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should make sure I'm not missing any details. The recipe starts by warming the tortilla, then adds queso sauce, taco meat, and tostada shell or tortilla chips. Then sour cream, lettuce, cheese, and optional veggies are added. Wrapping it up and cooking each side for a few minutes completes it.\n",

Then it explains cooking them in a pan by flipping and pressing with a spatula. So I can summarize those steps.\n",

      "\n",
      "In another section on page 78, it refers to Cushing’s syndrome caused by high levels of hydrocortisone, which is a type of corticosteroid.

      "\n",

      "Tricyclic antidepressants are a class of medications designed to alleviate symptoms of depression by correcting chemical imbalances in the brain. Named for their three-ring chemical structure, these drugs were first discovered in the 1950s and are used not only for depression but also for conditions like bulimia, panic disorders, and certain types of chronic pain. They work by affecting neurotransmitters such as serotonin and norepinephrine, which helps reduce symptoms of sadness, hopelessness, and low energy.\n",

      "Commonly prescribed tricyclic antidepressants include amitriptyline (Elavil), desipramine (Norpramin), imipramine (Tofranil), nortriptyline (Pamelor), and protriptyline (Vivactil). These drugs are available by prescription and come in various forms, including tablets, capsules, liquids, and injections.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tricyclic antidepressants can cause side effects due to their broad impact on the body's chemical balance. They may lead to anticholinergic effects like dry mouth and blurred vision, as well as cardiac issues such as arrhythmias. Patients should be cautious when combining these drugs with other medications, especially MAO inhibitors, alcohol, or CNS depressants, as interactions can occur.\n",
